        <h1>Report</h1>
        <p>
          Mr. William Anderson was a middle-aged wealthy businessman who took
          over his mother’s business. Despite the fact that the business was
          well established by his mother, his hard work and effort made the
          business reach great heights due to which he was also a target for
          many of his rival companies. For the last five years, after Mr.
          Anderson was diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure and heart
          ailment, he often depended on his younger brother and his personal
          assistant for business related and official matters. His other family
          members include his old father, wife and a 19-year-old son. <br />
          On the night of 29 January 2021, dead body of Mr. William Anderson was
          found lying on the staircase of his mansion. According to the forensic
          report, the estimated time of death was around 9-10 PM and the cause
          of death was cardiac arrest due to pacemaker failure. The prime
          suspects of the murder are his family members- his father, son, wife,
          younger brother and his personal assistant. <br />
          You are appointed as the detective for this murder case and it’s your
          job to find out who the actual murderer is. <br />
        </p>
        <h1 class="h11">Susupect List</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Wife (Mrs. Misty Anderson):</b> Mrs. Anderson, the businessman’s
          wife was an independent woman. She was the daughter of the owner of
          the businessman’s rival company. She used to help her husband with his
          business at times.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Father (Mr. Bryan Anderson):</b>
          Mr. Bryan Anderson was the the victim’s step-dad. He always wanted his
          own son (the victim’s younger brother) to take over the company which
          set up by his wife. He thought his own son was more qualified and
          hence more deserving that Mr. William Anderson.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Son (Wilmort Anderson):</b>
          Wilmort Anderson was a spoiled brat, drug addict, short-tempered and
          spendthrift 19-year-old boy who did nothing other than wasting his
          father’s money to support his extravagant lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>P.A (Arnold Burns):</b>
          Arnold Burns, the personal assistant of the businessman was a tech
          geek. He had been working for him since the past five years and was
          one of the trusted persons of the businessman and his family members.
          Mr. Burns also used to take care of Mr. William Anderson’s medical
          issues. He had a son who was suffering from an unusual disease called
          neurofibromatosis and his son’s treatment required a large amount of
          money which Mr. Anderson used provide him with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Younger brother (Kevin Anderson): </b>
          Kevin Anderson was the victim’s step-brother. He was a highly
          qualified, intelligent and had an MBA degree. Although he’s did not
          share any ownership of the company, he used to advices and solutions
          on business related problems and matters to his elder step- brother.

        <h1>Susupect Statements</h1>
        <div>
          <h3>Wife</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Detective:</b> &nbsp Where were you around 9-10pm when the murder
            happened?<br />
            <br />
            <b>Wife:</b> &nbsp It was dinner time and I was setting up the
            dinner table. When I went to call the rest of my family members for
            dinner, I saw William’s dead body lying on the staircase.
            <br />
            <br /><b>Detective:</b> &nbsp Who do you think killed your husband?
            What could be the possible motives? <br /><br /><b>Wife:</b> &nbsp I
            strongly believe my brother-in-law is involved with this murder. He
            wanted the ownership of the company and he always thought himself to
            be more intelligent, deserving and smart than my husband. My
            brother-in-law was always jealous of him. Although my husband used
            to depend on him a lot, they often got involved in nasty fights over
            the future of our business.
          </p>
          <h3>Father</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Detective:</b> &nbsp According to the victim’s wife, your sons
            lately got involved in fights over the future of your family
            business. What do you have to say about that?
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Father:</b> &nbsp Yes, they often got involved in fights because
            they had a lot of disagreements about the future of our family
            business. I always wanted my own son to control the business. He is
            intelligent, highly qualified and much smarter than William. I
            believe he had greater capability to handle the business, but my
            wife gave the company to my elder son and there was nothing that I
            could do about it.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Detective:</b> &nbsp Who do you think committed this gruesome
            deed?
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Father:</b> &nbsp I am sure his wife committed this crime. She
            belongs from a wealthy business family and we got them married
            because we wanted to build a partnership deal with her father’s
            company. Our relations were good and we wanted to strengthen our
            bond with them. But six years back, due to growing differences
            between the board members of the two companies, we were forced to
            split up and now the two companies are rivals. Misty’s behaviour
            changed a lot since then. She even tried to poison her own husband
            twice but failed.
          </p>
          <h3>P.A</h3>
          <p>
            <b> Detective:</b> &nbsp How long have you been working for him?
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>P.A :</b> &nbsp I have been working for Mr. Anderson for the past
            five years. Mr. Anderson was a kind man and he loved me a lot. My
            son has been suffering from an unusual disease and Mr. Anderson used
            to help me with my son’s treatment. His death feels like a great
            personal loss to me.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Detective:</b> &nbsp Was everything going fine with the business?
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>P.A :</b> &nbsp We always had trouble. Mr. William Anderson’s
            step father used to interfere in the business dealings and he never
            got along well with Mr. William. He often tried to instigate his own
            son against his step-son. He wanted his own son to become the owner
            of the company.
          </p>
          <h3>Younger Brother</h3>
          <p>
            <b> Detective:</b> &nbsp Everyone seems to target you; do you have
            anything to say about it?
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Younger brother:</b> &nbsp What rubbish! I loved my brother very
            much. Yes, I agree we got involved in fights lately but we always
            resolved them in a peaceful manner. I always helped him in the
            business and my brother used to consult me about various matters. We
            had very good terms. How can I kill my brother?
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Detective:</b> &nbsp According to you, who might have killed your
            brother?
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Younger brother:</b> &nbsp It’s definitely his son. My nephew is
            a drug addict and his demands for money kept on increasing every
            day. He never got along well with anyone in the family. He always
            had disagreements with his father and they often use had arguments
            and fights when my brother denied to pay him any extra money for his
            extravagant life-style. My nephew is very greedy and he might have a
            possible motive to kill my brother. He even used to have heated
            arguments with Mr. Arnold Burns as he caught my nephew stealing
            money from my brother’s cupboard several times.
          </p>
          <h3>Son</h3>
          <p>
            <b> Detective:</b> &nbsp How are coping up in this difficult time?
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Son:</b> &nbsp It’s a really difficult for me. I loved and
            respected him a lot. Yes, we had our own share of fights and
            disagreements. But now I feel I have let him down. I failed to lived
            up to his expectations, I failed as a son. I never made him feel
            proud.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Detective:</b> &nbsp I am really sorry for your loss. So, tell me
            Wilmort, did you notice anything suspicious about anyone lately in
            the house?
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Son:</b> &nbsp That guy, my Dad’s PA, he is the culprit. He used
            to get involved in our family matters. He even started to show more
            concern about my Dad’s medical issues. He used to take him to the
            doctor for monthly check-ups and also took care of his medicines
            which I felt was a little unusual. My Dad was a kind man and he used
            to give Arnold Burns a lot of money for his son’s treatment. But one
            day I heard my dad shouting on him and I faintly remember him
            telling Burns that he won’t give him any extra penny for his son’s
            treatment. I even saw an email oh Burns’ laptop from our rival
            company which made me suspicious. On questing him, he told me they
            were making a deal to partner on a project together. That man is
            very suspicious and he has amazing technical skills. I never liked
            him getting involved in our family matters.
